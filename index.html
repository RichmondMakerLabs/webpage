                    a making laboratory, and a making community. Do you need help with anything electrical,
                    mechanical
                    or
                    technical? Or can you offer such help? Contact us or just drop in to a meeting!</p>

                <p>Access and membership is free but we accept donations and some materials will need to be paid
                    for.
                    Chat
                    with us about how to do this.</p>

                <h3>Plan your first visit</h3>
                <p>By far the best thing to do is to come visit. But we also have a great <a
                        href="https://wiki.richmondmakerlabs.uk/index.php/Main_Page">wiki-page</a> with lots of
                    extra
                    information maybe have a look at the stuff we have been doing in our blog. <a
                        href="https://wiki.richmondmakerlabs.uk/index.php/Blog_2024">in our blog</a>.</p>
                <p>We appreciate it's sometimes uncomfortable to walk into a room of people and introduce yourself. Some
                    of these points may help you understand what to expect.</p>
                <ul class="general">
                    <li>First off, just come down to see us and have a look around, no forms to fill out before.
                    </li>
                    <li>We do ask that anyone under 18 is accompanied by an adult.
                    </li>
                    <li>Check we're open: We meet nearly every Tuesday and Thursday from 7.30 at this location - any
                        announcements will be on the Main Page
                    </li>
                    <li>We'll give you a copy of this when you visit but feel free to read through the Member info
                        notes. (small PDF download)
                    </li>
                    <li>Have a look through our Facilities Page to see if there's anything we have that takes your
                        interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>Someone will be able to welcome you and give you a tour - but it's done on a first come, first
                        served basis so you may have to wait a short period.
                    </li>
                    <li>It's worth noting that some tools need training before use. Whether we're able to do that on the
                        night is largely down to who is available, but if you're aiming to use something specific please
                        feel free to ask through methods below
                    </li>
                    <li>You'll probably get the most out of your first session if you come with something you want to
                        achieve - but it's no problem if you just want to come and say hello and get a sense of what's
                        there. Just be aware that, whilst people can often help with advice on how to do things, we
                        don't currently have projects to suggest.
                    </li>
                    <li>Most importantly, people are friendly and please feel free to wander round and ask people what
                        sorts of things they're working on - they'll usually be keen to show you.</li>
