# Revamping The RML site
As agreed  y Andres and Vish:

Basically, no extra work, improve everything, throw away cruft

1. Google info - the tagline should be something like, "A community workshop and makerspace in Richmond, London" - Not Ham or Surrey - the former has little recognition and the latter hasn't been correct since 1964.
2. The massive hero section ought to go
3. Front page should include facilities, location, opening times and info on donations
4. AND several links to the Telegram channel Just a direct link in

We can argue about what the most important thing is So that goes on top
Imagine people on their phone seeing the site
And words next to the pictures instead of on-hover - no more on-hovers, they don't work on phones
Menu bar at top is largely pointless. But it shrinks on mobile
